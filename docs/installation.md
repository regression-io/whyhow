## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during installation, please check the following:

- Ensure that you have Python 3.10 or higher installed. You can check your Python version by running `python --version` in your terminal.
- Make sure that you have correctly set the `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `PINECONE_API_KEY`, `NEO4J_URL`, `NEO4J_USER`, `NEO4J_PASSWORD` environment variables with your respective credentials.
- If you are installing from GitHub, ensure that you have cloned the repository correctly and are in the right directory.
- If you are using a virtual environment, make sure that it is activated before running the installation commands.
- If you still face problems, please open an issue on the GitHub repository with detailed information about the error and your environment setup.
