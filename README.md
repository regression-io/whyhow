The WhyHow Knowledge Graph Creation SDK enables you to quickly and easily build automated knowledge graphs tailored to your unique worldview. Instantly build, extend, and query well-scoped KGs with your data.

# Installation

# How to

## Initialize SDK

Import the SDK and initialize the client using your WhyHow API key.

```shell
from whyhow import WhyHow

client = WhyHow(api_key=<your whyhow api key>)
```

For Azure Open AI: 

```shell
from whyhow import WhyHow

client = WhyHow(api_key=<your whyhow api key>, use_azure=True)
```

For an alternative model (for example, healthcare for text extraction): 

```shell
from whyhow import WhyHow

client = WhyHow(api_key=<your whyhow api key>, model_type='health')
```

## Add documents to namespace

Your namespace is a logical grouping of the raw data you upload, the seed concepts you define, and the graphs you create. Namespaces are meant to be tightly scoped to your use case. You can create as many namespaces as you want.

```shell

namespace = "harry-potter"
documents = ["files/harry_potter_and_the_philosophers_stone.pdf","files/harry_potter_and_the_chamber_of_secrets.pdf"]

documents_response = client.graph.add_documents(namespace, documents)
print(documents_response)
# Adding your documents

```

## Create a graph

You can create a graph in three different ways. First, you can create a graph using a user-defined schema, giving you complete control over the types of entities and relationships that are extracted and used to build the graph. You can also create a graph using a set of seed questions. In this case, WhyHow will automatically extract entities and relationships that are most applicable to the things you want to know, and construct a graph from these concepts. Or, you can fully deterministically create a graph from structured context in the form of a CSV.

Create graph with **schema** if...

1. Your graph must adhere to a consistent structure.
2. You are very familiar with the structure of your raw documents.
3. You need comprehensive extraction of concepts across the entire document.

Create graph with **seed questions** if...

1. You are unsure as to which relationships and patterns you'd like to build into your graph.
2. You want to build your graph with only the most semantically similar raw data.

Create graph with **csv** if...

1. You alrady know the structure of your data.
2. You already have data stored in a table format.

### Create a graph with schema

Tell the WhyHow SDK exactly which entities, relationships, and patterns you'd like to extract and build into your graph by defining them in a JSON-based schema.

```shell

#schema.json

{
  "entities": [
    {
      "name": "character",
      "description": "A person appearing in the book, e.g., Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Albus Dumbledore."
    },
    {
      "name": "object",
      "description": "Inanimate items that characters use or interact with, e.g., wand, Philosopher's Stone, Invisibility Cloak, broomstick."
    }
    ...
  ],
  "relations": [
    {
      "name": "friends with",
      "description": "Denotes a friendly relationship between characters."
    },
    {
      "name": "interacts with",
      "description": "Describes a scenario in which a character engages with another character, creature, or object."
    },
    ...
  ],
  "patterns": [
    {
      "head": "character",
      "relation": "friends with",
      "tail": "character",
      "description": "One character is friends with another, e.g., Harry Potter is friends with Ron Weasley."
    },
    {
      "head": "character",
      "relation": "interacts with",
      "tail": "object",
      "description": "A character interacting with an object, e.g., Harry Potter interacts with the Invisibility Cloak."
    }
  ]
}

```

Using this schema, we extract relevant concepts from your raw data, construct triples, and generate a graph according to the patterns you define.

```shell
# Create graph from schema

schema = "files/schema.json"
create_graph_with_schema_response = client.graph.create_graph_from_schema(namespace, schema)
print(create_graph_with_schema_response)
# Creating your graph

```

### Create a graph with seed questions

Tell the WhyHow SDK what you care about by providing a list of concepts in the form of natural language questions. Using these questions, we create a small ontology to guide extraction of entities and relationships that are most relevant to your use case, then construct a graph.

```shell

questions = ["What does Harry wear?","Who is Harry friends with?"]

create_graph_response = client.graph.create_graph(namespace, questions)
print(create_graph_response)
# Creating your graph

```

### Create a graph with a csv

Provide a CSV and a schema (or automatically generate one using the `generate_schema` method) to create a graph. WhyHow will automatically extract entities and relationships from your CSV headers and data.

```shell

namespace = "specialists"
documents = ["../examples/assets/specialists.csv"]
schema_file = "../examples/assets/specialists.json"

# Automatically generate a schema
schema = client.graph.generate_schema(documents=documents)

# Create a graph from a CSV and the schema you bring/build
csv_graph = client.graph.create_graph_from_csv(
    namespace=namespace, schema_file=schema_file
)

# Query the graph created from csv using specific entities and relations
query = "Who speaks English and live in Houston?"
entities = ["English","Houston"]
relations = ["SPEAKS","LIVE_IN"]

specific_query_response = client.graph.query_graph_specific(
    namespace=namespace,
    query=query,
    entities=entities,
    relations=relations,
    include_triples=False,
    include_chunks=False,
)

```

WhyHow.AI is building tools to help developers bring more determinism and control to their RAG pipelines using graph structures. If you're thinking about, in the process of, or have already incorporated knowledge graphs in RAG, weâ€™d love to chat at team@whyhow.ai, or follow our newsletter at [WhyHow.AI](https://www.whyhow.ai/).
